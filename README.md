# Risky Business

My name is Oscar Lopez, a student at the University of Miami FinTech Bootcamp course.

In this activity, I was task with building and evaluating machine learning models to predict credit risk using data from lending services for online mortgage, student, and auto loans without the use of banks.
I will need to employ various techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes and then use the imbalance-learn and Scikit-learned libraries to build and evaluate said models with the Resampling and Ensemble Learning techniques.

In this assignment, I relied on the class activities to complete the two started codes (Resampling and Ensemble) to conquer the challenges I had, specially when importing libraries not it the started code.
